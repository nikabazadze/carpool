# Hari
This is the final HTML-CSS open-ended project from the Codecademy's Full-Stack Engineering course.

## Overview
In this project, I had to build a static website using HTML5 and CSS3 about a fictional product/company. Because it's a final HTML-CSS project, the main goal of this project is to use everything I have learned about HTML and CSS. This is an open-ended project without any guidence what to build or how. I chose to build a static website for the carpooling company called Hari, which connects drivers (non-comercial) with passengers going to the same destination and is intended for long-distance intercity traveling. Main motiviation to build a site around this product is that I was a founder of this carpooling company years ago. Now knowing how to build a website on my own, I wanted to build it for the company that I once founded and was not able to build (write code) on my own back then.
